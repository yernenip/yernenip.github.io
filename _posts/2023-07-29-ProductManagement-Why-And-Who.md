As someone who has spent the majority of my career in the software engineering and architecture space, I made a significant shift to Product Management a few years ago. My decision was driven by a desire to be involved in the early stages of product creation and to experience the excitement of innovation and ambiguity. Although the transition has been rewarding, I often find myself slipping into my engineering mindset instead of fully embracing the Product Manager’s perspective.  

One of my greatest challenges is consistently asking the fundamental question: **“Why?”**. Whenever someone presents a problem that needs solving, I tend to immediately jump into problem-solving mode and focusing on finding solutions, without taking a step back to look at the problem holistically. I understand the importance of brainstorming various ideas and thoroughly working through them to arrive at the right problem-market fit. This realization has been both frustrating and a valuable learning opportunity for me, and I am committed to improving over time through the concept of [Kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen).  

I would like to share my insights and experiences that I believe will be valuable for anyone making the transition from engineering to product management. When examining a product, I recommend thinking about it in six key stages (**Why, Who, What, Where, How and When**), and in this blog post, we will focus on the first two stages:  

<!-- excerpt -->

# Why — The Foundation:
Understanding the purpose and significance of the product is crucial before delving into specifics. By answering the “Why” questions, we lay a solid foundation for the rest of the product development journey.  

### Why is this problem important to work on?
Identifying the significance of the problem we aim to solve is essential. Recognizing its implications and potential consequences fuels our motivation and commitment to finding a solution.  

### How does solving this problem benefit both the organization and customers/users?
Evaluating the benefits that the solution offers to both the organization and its customers or users is critical. A successful product should create value for all stakeholders involved.  

### Why should we invest time and money on this problem?
Resources, such as time and money, are valuable commodities in any organization. Justifying the investment in solving this problem requires a clear understanding of the expected outcomes and returns.  

# Who — The Key Stakeholders:
Knowing the key stakeholders is essential for effective product management. This encompasses understanding the needs, preferences, and pain points of Users, Customers, and Partners, as well as considering how the product aligns with the organization’s objectives. Additionally, examining the broader impact of the product on society and the planet ensures a comprehensive perspective.  

### Who are the users/customers who would benefit from this? What are their pain points?
Identifying the target users or customers and understanding their pain points provides crucial insights. This knowledge helps tailor the product to meet their specific needs effectively.  

Once you have thoughtfully answered these questions and are convinced about the potential of your ideas, only then should you proceed to the other stages of product development. Below is a brief example of how I would answer these questions for a problem that is close to my heart:  

# Problem Statement: Providing Access to Education and Learning for Children in Underserved Communities
### Why is this problem important to work on?
**Significance:** This problem is of utmost importance as it addresses the educational disparities faced by children in underserved communities. The lack of access to quality education limits their future opportunities and perpetuates the cycle of poverty. By working on this problem, we can break down barriers and create a more equitable society, where all children have a chance to reach their full potential through education.  

**Motivation:** The significance of this problem is a powerful driving force behind our actions. We firmly believe that every child deserves the right to education and learning. By providing access to educational resources, we can empower these children to build better futures for themselves and contribute positively to their communities.  

### How does solving this problem benefit both the organization and children/users?
**Benefits for the Organization:** Addressing this problem showcases the organization’s commitment to social responsibility and community development. Contributing to the education of underserved children enhances the organization’s reputation, fostering positive relationships with stakeholders, including customers, employees, and partners. Additionally, investing in education creates a more educated and skilled future workforce, benefiting the organization and society in the long run.  

**Benefits for Children/Users:** Solving this problem directly impacts the lives of underserved children by offering them access to quality education and learning resources. Education opens doors to new opportunities, better career prospects, and improved socio-economic conditions. By acquiring knowledge and skills, these children gain the tools they need to break free from poverty and contribute positively to their communities.  

### Why should we invest time and money in this problem?
**Expected Outcomes:** Investing in this problem will lead to empowered and educated individuals who can drive positive change in their communities. These children will have improved life prospects, and the cycle of poverty will gradually diminish. As education spreads, the overall socio-economic conditions of underserved communities will improve, fostering inclusive growth and development.  

**Returns on Investment:** The returns on investing in education for underserved children go beyond financial gains. The impact of educated individuals on society is immeasurable and invaluable. As children access better education, they become active contributors to the economy, reducing dependency on social support systems. Furthermore, this investment fosters goodwill, strengthens community ties, and creates a brighter and more hopeful future for all.  

### Who are the users/customers who would benefit from this? What are their pain points?
**Users/Customers:** The primary beneficiaries of addressing this problem are children who belong to underserved communities. These children face numerous barriers to accessing quality education, including financial constraints, lack of infrastructure, limited resources, and social disparities. Additionally, their families often struggle to afford basic educational necessities such as textbooks, school supplies, and uniforms. Moreover, some of these communities may lack schools or have inadequate facilities and qualified teachers.  

### Pain Points:
1. **Limited Access to Quality Education:** Children in underserved communities often have limited or no access to quality educational institutions, hindering their learning and personal growth.
2. **Financial Constraints:** Families in these communities may face financial hardships, making it difficult to afford education-related expenses.
3. **Educational Resources:** The lack of essential educational resources, such as textbooks and learning materials, hampers the children’s ability to study effectively.
4. **Infrastructure Challenges:** Some underserved communities lack proper school infrastructure, including classrooms, libraries, and computer labs, further hindering the learning experience.
5. **Qualified Teachers:** Finding and retaining qualified teachers in these areas can be challenging, resulting in subpar educational experiences.
Social Disparities: Discrimination and social disparities may impact the children’s self-esteem and confidence, affecting their motivation to pursue education.  

By understanding and addressing these pain points, we can work towards creating inclusive and effective educational solutions that empower children from underserved communities and give them a fair chance to thrive and succeed in life.  

**Note:** *The examples provided above, aim to highlight the importance of providing access to education for underserved communities. The real-world context and implications of such initiatives may vary based on specific situations and locations.*  

In upcoming blog posts, we will dive into the remaining stages, including “What”, “Where”, “How” and “When” to provide a holistic view of the product management process.
