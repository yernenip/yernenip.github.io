"Musings of a Tech Philosopher" is a personal website and blog where I share my thoughts on leadership, product management, and technology, 
with a passion for the transformative potential of AI and ML.
</p>
<p>
With over two decades of experience in the tech industry, I've navigated a dynamic career path that spans from technical support to software engineering, 
software architecture, software engineering management, and product management. Throughout my journey, 
I've had the privilege of leading teams ranging from 5 to over 35 talented individuals, always leading by example and with a hands-on approach.

<p>
My passion is twofold: I cherish the art of coding and the process of bringing innovative solutions to life, 
just as much as I am dedicated to immersing myself in the intricacies of customer challenges and their unique journeys. 
This deep understanding forms the bedrock of my quest to unearth the perfect product-market fit.

In a tech landscape often compartmentalized by well-defined roles, I proudly bridge the divide between product management and engineering, 
embracing the synthesis of these two worlds.
